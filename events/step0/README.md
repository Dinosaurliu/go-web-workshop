# Step 0: basic architecture

The goal on this step is to define the two entrypoints to your web application.

You can try running before you start coding to see the current behavior.

    $ goapp serve

Once you've implemented this visiting localhost:8080 should display a list of conferences,
and clicking "New Event" should not do anything.

You can also deploy it.

    $ goapp deploy --version=step0 --application=your-project-id

And then visit http://step0.your-project-id.appspot.com .

Once you're done, let's go back to the [instructions](../../section05/README.md#congratulations).
