# Building Web Applications with Go

Welcome, gopher! You're not a gopher?
Well, this workshop is for gophers, or people that use the [Go programming language][1].
But fear not if you've never written any Go before!
I'd recommend you learn the basics for the language first with the [Go tour][2].

## Setting up your workspace

To go through this you will need the following:

1. You have installed the [Go Programming Language][1].
1. You have setup a `GOPATH` by following the [How to Write Go Code][9] tutorial.
1. You are somewhat familiar with the basics of Go. (The [Go Tour][2] is a pretty good place to start)
1. You have a Google account and you have installed the [Go SDK][3].

## Contents

There's a lot to say about how to build web applications, in Go or any other language.
But we only have one day so we won't try to cover too much.
Instead we'll cover the basics, so you'll be able to explore other solutions and frameworks later.

The workshops is divided in eleven sections:

- [0: Hello world](section00/README.md)
- [1: Web Clients](section01/README.md)
- [2: Web servers](section02/README.md)
- [3: Input validation and status codes](section03/README.md)
- [4: Deploying to App Engine](section04/README.md)
- [5: Hello, HTML](section05/README.md)
- [6: JSON encoding and decoding](section06/README.md)
- [7: Durable storage with Cloud Datastore](section07/README.md)
- [8: Retrieving remote resources with urlfetch](section08/README.md)
- [9: What is Memcache and how to use it from App Engine](section09/README.md)
- [10: Congratulations!](section10/README.md)

## Community

My favorite aspect of Go is its community, and you are now part of it too. Welcome!

As a newcomer to the Go community you might have questions or get blocked at some point.
This is completely normal, and we're here to help you.
Some of the places where gophers tend to hang out are:

- a mailing list [golang-nuts@googlegroups.com](mailto:golang-nuts@googlegroups.com)
- a [Slack community](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/gophers-slack-community/)
- a [Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/)
- an IRC channel: #go-nuts on irc.freenode.net
